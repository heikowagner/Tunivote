Yesterday, after 13 years, another chapter of the Arab Spring was written. While the Arab Spring in Tunisia paved the way for a democratic system (which is still at risk), the movement led to a devastating civil war in other parts of the region. 

In 2011, I had the honor of being part of the Tunivote team. The goal was to support the democratic process and, similar to Germany's Wahl-O-Mat, provide people with an assessment of the political parties.

This was crucial, as more than 100 parties ran in the young democracy. While others focused on engaging with the political parties, I took on the task of programming the website.

Millions of Tunisians used the tool (if I remember correctly, one in ten). The developments in Syria later moved me to upload the tool's code to GitHub under the MIT License. 

The code is now outdated, and I'm not even sure if this is the final version or if it still works in any way. But perhaps someone will find it and be inspired to create a similar tool for Syria.
